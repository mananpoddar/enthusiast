                                                         Better rescue solutions







Problem Statement :
At the time of natural calamity to make the rescue operation more effective, there is a need to get a count of the number of people to be rescued 
from particular regions.
Also one should know the optimal number of rescue crew to be sent to each region.
Also from this information, we can distribute funds to each region precisely.
Distribution of funds can be made more transparent by making information of all transactions public.

Solution:
A Web application:
A person affected will use this application to give details of his / her address with some identity card ( one person may provide information of 
multiple people along with him/her)
Now we get information about the count of people in different regions over the affected area and allocate rescue teams in every region.
At the same time information about funds raised and distributed by individuals/ organizations/government will be displayed on the web application to maintain transparency. 
Information of exact count of people affected in particular region along with funds allocated in that region is displayed on the web 
application.
